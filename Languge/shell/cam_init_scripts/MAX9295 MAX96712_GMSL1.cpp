/**************************************************
This is a programming example for MAX96712 pairing with GMSL1 Serializers; Modify based on applications.

Example Setup Details:
MAX96705 #1 -----------------------------> MAX96712 Link A -------------> Map to VC1, Aggregated on 1x4 D-PHY Port A
Parallel RAW12					   ------> Pipe 0 (by default)
MAX96705 #2 -----------------------------> MAX96712 Link B -------------> Map to VC0, Aggregated on 1x4 D-PHY Port A
Parallel RAW12					   ------> Pipe 1 (by default)
MAX96705 #3 -----------------------------> MAX96712 Link C -------------> Map to VC2, Aggregated on 1x4 D-PHY Port A
Parallel RAW12					   ------> Pipe 2 (by default)
MAX96705 #4 -----------------------------> MAX96712 Link D -------------> Map to VC3, Aggregated on 1x4 D-PHY Port A
Parallel RAW12					   ------> Pipe 3 (by default)
